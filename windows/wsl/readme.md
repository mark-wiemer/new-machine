# Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

I don't recommend this, as it uses port 8080 and Ctrl+C doesn't seem to kill most commands in terminal. Good luck!

Currently using Ubuntu and only on work machine(s), so I don't use these files much. Personal machine has NixOS installed natively for Linux work.
