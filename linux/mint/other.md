# Linux Mint setup

I'm trying out Linux Mint as an alternative to Windows and NixOS because I'm new at this and willing to sacrifice customizability for convenience.

## Snipaste alternative: Flameshot

1. Install Flameshot
2. Setup a keyboard shortcut that activates `flameshot gui` on `F7`
3. Use Ctrl+C to copy Flameshot selections :)
