# Linux Mint setup

I'm trying out Linux Mint as an alternative to Windows and NixOS because I'm new at this and willing to sacrifice customizability for convenience.

## Glossary

Windows | Linux Mint
--|--
taskbar | panel
Start Menu | home menu
Windows key, abbr. `Win` | Super key, abbr. `<Super>`


## Clipboard history: Diodon

1. Install from Software Manager
1. Set custom keyboard shortcut to `/usr/bin/diodon`

(Parcellite is not used because it just doesn't paste into this file in GitHub + Firefox, for instance)


## Firefox

1. Vertical tabs: `about:config` > `sidebar.verticalTabs` > `true`
2. Change default search engine
3. Firefox is probably up-to-date, but can only be updated via [Update Manager](https://forums.linuxmint.com/viewtopic.php?t=412975)
   > View current version at Menu > Help > About Firefox


## Cinnamenu

1. Install from Applets
2. Set to search with Bing
3. Disable sidebar
4. Right click panel > Panel settings > Panel edit mode > Drag Cinnamenu to the left, replacing Menu


## Snipaste alternative: Flameshot

1. Install from Software Manager
2. Setup a keyboard shortcut that activates `flameshot gui` on `F7`
3. Use Ctrl+C to copy Flameshot selections :)
